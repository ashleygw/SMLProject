# Data Modeling of Restaurants in Walla Walla
This was my final project in Discreet Mathematics. It models restaurants in Walla Walla. Most of the data used is taken from Google.
There are functions used to sort the data and some nice print statements.

This was a collaborative project with Brooke Taylor.
